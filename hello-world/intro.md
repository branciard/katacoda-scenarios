# Install and run your first application with iexec

In this tutorial you will learn how to install and use the iexec software development kit (iexec-sdk).

You will create your first smart contract that does a very simple off-chain computation: compute the factorial function of an integer.

You will learn the basic of the IexecOracleAPI and deploy the smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain.

At the end of the tutorial, you will see how your smart contract can now interact with iexec oracle to launch off-chain computation on the decentralized Cloud.

Let's get started!
