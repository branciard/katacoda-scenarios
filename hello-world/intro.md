# Install and run your first application with iexec

Iexec allows Ethereum developpers to create applications that can be executed off-chain. This packages bring all the tools to develop, deploy and execute Dapps on Ethereum and iexec. Using these tools, you will be able to deploy any legacy applications in the iexec infrastructure and execute them through calls to Ethereum smart contracts.

In this tutorial you will learn how to install and use the iexec software development kit (iexec-sdk).

You will create your first smart contract that does a very simple off-chain computation: compute the factorial function of an integer.

You will learn the basic of the IexecOracleAPI and deploy the smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain.

At the end of the tutorial, you will see how your smart contract can now interact with iexec oracle to launch off-chain computation on the decentralized Cloud.

Let's get started!
